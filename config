# Which SIMD instruction sets to use for string and bitset I/O. Valid values: 'none', 'sse4.1',
# 'avx2'. 'none' is the safest one, 'avx2' is present on most modern computers, including Codeforces
# servers. 'sse4.1' is a middle-ground option available since Silvermont. Apart from better generic
# CPU support, using 'none' or 'sse4.1' will reduce code size. Choose 'avx2' if unsure.
simd=avx2

# Whether to use a precomputed 200-byte lookup table for integer output. This typically increases
# performance, but might affect cache negatively in cache-intensive tasks. Slightly increases code
# size. Choose 'y' if unsure.
lut=y

# Whether to treat int8_t/signed char and uint8_t/unsigned char just like char, as a symbol as
# opposed to an integer. This also enables printing of '(un)signed char*' strings in addition to the
# 'char*' strings, which are enabled by default. This is mostly an STL compatibility option than
# anything useful by itself. Choose 'y' if unsure.
char_with_sign_is_glyph=y

# Whether to support <bitset> I/O. This will benefit from using SIMD significantly. This also
# increases code size significantly. Choose 'y' if unsure.
bitset=y

# Whether to support floating-point I/O. This increases code size significantly. Choose 'y' if
# unsure.
float=y

# Whether to support <complex> I/O. Choose 'y' if unsure.
complex=y

# Whether to support test systems that don't redirect stdin/stdout from/to file, but use pipes.
# Using 'y' makes I/O work in such environments, if somewhat slower than direct file I/O. Using 'n'
# will trigger crashes in these environments. Choose 'y' if unsure.
pipe=y

# Whether to support graceful end-of-file handling on stdin. Namely, 'while (std::cin >> ...)'
# syntax is only allowed with this option set. This EOF handling is not fully compatible with std:
# reading from a EOF pipe twice will cause crashes, so you would need to terminate immediately.
# Choose 'y' if unsure.
stdin_eof=y

# Whether to support freopen. If 'y', calling freopen on stdin or stdout before the first I/O
# operation will successfully redirect the stream. If 'n', this may or may not work for cin/cout.
# Choose 'y' if unsure.
late_binding=y

# Whether to replace std::cerr/std::clog with a /dev/null-like stream if ONLINE_JUDGE is set. This
# enables logs like 'std::cerr << ...' to be zero-cost on environments such as Codeforces. Choose
# 'y' if unsure.
cerr=y
